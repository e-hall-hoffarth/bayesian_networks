Ideas for bayesian network project:

Find way to deal with dynamic nature of relationships in data.
	Dynamic Bayesian Network
	Include lags for any variables that fail a unit root test

Find way (if possible) to deal with simultaneous nature of relationships between some variables. 

Sample from bayesian network (rbn) and compare generated samples to input data in some meaningful way. Perhaps use to compute IRFs.

Experiment more with score based hybrid learning methods.

Reasonable use of blacklist/whitelist to get expected graphs.

Use as.lm to express all endogenous (non-root) variables as a functions of the exogenous (root) variables. This should create something equivalent to a RE solution. Try to get CI for the parameter estimates so we can test whether it has indeed identified the correct solution.

Identifiability assumptions: Under what conditions (on the underlying DSGE) will it be possible to identify the structural model correctly?

Relate restrictions assumed by DAGs to Choelesky decomposition in a generalised way.

Better performance using log variables? Why might that be the case if we take a linear approximation anyway?

Write liturature review, in particular relating to other work in economics.

Consider higher-order v-strucs to see if more could be learned from them.

Lucas Critique: These models are reduced form so they will not be immune. However, we can still identify the effect of shocks even if we cannot identify the effects of a change in parameter and in many cases this may be of more interest anyway.
